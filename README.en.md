# Tainan City Council WatchBot

[ä¸­æ–‡](README.md) | English

This project is a chatbot using Line as the front-end, connected to multiple LLM providers including OpenAI Assistant API, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Ollama. The bot supports RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality and will be deployed on Google Cloud Run with Google Cloud SQL for thread management.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- Access to OpenAI API
- A Line Developers account

## Obtaining OpenAI API Token

1. Register/Login at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create a new Project from the avatar menu in the upper left corner.
3. Once inside the Project, navigate to Project â†’ API Key.
4. Click `+ Create` in the upper right corner to generate an OpenAI API Token.

## Setting Up OpenAI Assistant API

1. **Create an Assistant**
   - Within the project, go to "Playground" at the top, then select "Assistants" on the left to enter the OpenAI Assistant API interface. Create a new Assistant.

2. **Upload Required Files for Database**
   - In the Assistant interface, configure the name and System instructions as the bot's default system prompt. It's recommended to select `gpt-4o` as the model and set Temperature to `0.01`.
   - Go to Tools â†’ File Search, click `+ Files` to upload files you want as the database.

3. **Testing in Playground**
   - Go to [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) and test the Assistantâ€™s functionality.

4. **Record assistant_id**
   - Under the Assistant name, thereâ€™s a text string representing the `assistant_id`. Note it down for later use.

## Configuring the Line Bot

1. **Create a Line Bot**
   - Log into the [Line Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/)
   - Create a new Provider and Channel (Messaging API).

2. **Get Channel Information**
   - In the Channel settings, obtain the `Channel Access Token` and `Channel Secret`.
   - Under `Basic Settings`, thereâ€™s a `Channel Secret`. Click `Issue` to generate your `channel_secret`.
   - Under `Messaging API`, thereâ€™s a `Channel Access Token`. Click `Issue` to generate your `channel_access_token`.

3. **Set Webhook URL**
   - Set the Webhook URL to the address of the Google Cloud Run deployment (this can be updated post-deployment).
   - Enable the Webhook by toggling the "Use Webhook" switch to on.

## Configuring Google Cloud SQL

1. **Create Cloud SQL Instance**
   - Go to [Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
   - Click **Create Instance** and choose the required database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

2. **Instance Configuration**
   - Set up the instance name and password.
   - Create an account for connection operations, noting down the username and password.
   - Create the database and use Cloud SQL Studio to run the following SQL command to create the table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE user_thread_table (
        user_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        thread_id VARCHAR(255),
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

3. **Get Connection Information**
   - After creating the instance, record the following details:
     - Instance Connection Name
     - Host
     - Port
     - Database Name
     - Username
     - Password

4. **Obtain SSL Certificates**
   - Go to the instance details page.
   - Under the **Connections** tab, enable SSL connections.
   - Download the following certificates:
     - Server CA Certificate
     - Client Certificate
     - Client Key
   - Convert these certificates and keys using the following commands:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in client-cert.pem -out ssl-cert.crt # Server CA Certificate
    openssl x509 -in server-ca.pem -out ca-cert.crt # Client Certificate
    openssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out ssl-key.key # Client Key
    ```

   - Copy `ssl-cert.crt`, `ca-cert.crt`, and `ssl-key.key` to `config/ssl/`.

## Finalizing Configuration Files

Prepare the following information:

- `channel_access_token`
- `channel_secret`
- `openai_api_key`
- `assistant_id`

Copy `config/config.yml.example` to `config/config.yml`, then modify its content as follows:

```yaml
line:
  channel_access_token: YOUR_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
  channel_secret: YOUR_CHANNEL_SECRET

openai:
  api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
  assistant_id: YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID

db:
  host: YOUR_DB_HOST
  port: 5432
  db_name: YOUR_DB_NAME
  user: YOUR_DB_USER
  password: YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
  sslmode: verify-ca
  sslrootcert: config/ssl/ca-cert.crt
  sslcert: config/ssl/client.crt
  sslkey: config/ssl/client.key
```

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run

### ðŸš€ Quick Deployment (Recommended)

Use our automated deployment scripts:

```bash
# 1. Set up deployment configuration
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
# Edit deploy/.env file with your project settings

# 2. Run automated deployment script
./deploy/deploy-to-cloudrun.sh
```

### ðŸ“– Comprehensive Deployment Guide

For complete deployment process, monitoring setup, load balancer configuration, etc., please refer to:
- [Complete Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Deployment Scripts Documentation](deploy/README.md)

### ðŸ”§ Manual Deployment (Advanced Users)

If you want to manually control each step:

1. **Configure Google Cloud Console**

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project {your-project-id}
   ```

2. **Build Container Image**

   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/{your-project-id}/{your-image-name} -f deploy/Dockerfile.cloudrun .
   ```

3. **Deploy to Cloud Run**

   ```bash
   gcloud run services replace deploy/cloudrun-service.yaml --region {your-region}
   ```

   - Replace placeholders with your actual information.

4. **Test Deployment Results**

   - After deployment, a Service URL will be returned, e.g., `https://chatgpt-line-bot-****.run.app`. Note this down.

5. **Set Webhook URL**

   - In the Line Bot settings, set the Webhook URL to the Service URL.
   - Enable Webhook by toggling the "Use Webhook" switch on.
   - Click Verify to check the connection.

## Testing the Application

1. **Access Chat Endpoint**
   - Go to the Service URL, e.g., `https://{your-cloud-run-url}/chat`, to ensure the app is running smoothly.

2. **Test with Line**
   - Send a message to your Line Bot to test its full functionality.

3. **Check Logs**
   - If issues arise, use `gcloud` or Google Cloud Console to inspect logs.
